## 🎯 Available Models

This deployment uses **DragonLLM/Qwen-Open-Finance-R-8B** (8B parameters), a free open-source model optimized for finance.

**Looking for more capable models?** DragonLLM offers commercial-licensed models with enhanced performance:

- **[LLM Open Finance Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/DragonLLM/llm-open-finance)** - Open-source financial models (8B variants)
- **[LLM Pro Finance Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/DragonLLM/llm-pro-finance)** - Commercial models (12B-70B) with advanced capabilities

These collections include models ranging from 8B to 70B parameters, optimized for finance, economics, and business use-cases.

## 📚 Research

This deployment is based on the **LLM Pro Finance Suite**, a collection of multilingual large language models specifically designed for financial applications. The models are fine-tuned on a curated, high-quality financial corpus comprising over 50% finance-related data in English, French, and German.

### Abstract

The financial industry's growing demand for advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities has highlighted the limitations of generalist large language models (LLMs) in handling domain-specific financial tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the LLM Pro Finance Suite, a collection of five instruction-tuned LLMs (ranging from 8B to 70B parameters) specifically designed for financial applications. Our approach focuses on enhancing generalist instruction-tuned models, leveraging their existing strengths in instruction following, reasoning, and toxicity control, while fine-tuning them on a curated, high-quality financial corpus comprising over 50% finance-related data in English, French, and German.

We evaluate the LLM Pro Finance Suite on a comprehensive financial benchmark suite, demonstrating consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in finance-oriented tasks and financial translation. Notably, our models maintain the strong general-domain capabilities of their base models, ensuring reliable performance across non-specialized tasks. This dual proficiency, enhanced financial expertise without compromise on general abilities, makes the LLM Pro Finance Suite an ideal drop-in replacement for existing LLMs in financial workflows, offering improved domain-specific performance while preserving overall versatility.

## 📊 Observability Setup

This deployment includes built-in support for **Langfuse** and **Logfire** to monitor model performance, track usage, and analyze capabilities. Both tools are pre-installed in the Docker images.

### Langfuse Setup

Langfuse provides LLM observability, tracing, and analytics. It helps you:
- **Track API calls** and model usage
- **Monitor performance** metrics (latency, token usage, costs)
- **Analyze model capabilities** and response quality
- **Debug issues** with detailed traces

#### 1. Create a Langfuse Account

1. Sign up at [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) (free tier available)
2. Or [self-host](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/self-host) your own instance

#### 2. Get Your API Keys

1. Go to **Settings → API Keys**
2. Create a new API key or use existing ones
3. Copy your **Public Key** and **Secret Key**

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

**For Hugging Face Spaces:**
1. Go to your Space settings
2. Add these secrets:
   ```
   LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
   LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
   LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com  # or your self-hosted URL
   ```

**For Koyeb:**
1. Go to your service settings
2. Add these environment variables:
   ```
   LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
   LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
   LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com
   ```

**For Local Docker:**
```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 \
  -e HF_TOKEN_LC2=your_token \
  -e LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-... \
  -e LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-... \
  -e LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com \
  open-finance-llm
```

#### 4. Verify Setup

1. Make a few API calls to your deployment
2. Check your Langfuse dashboard - you should see traces appearing
3. Explore metrics: latency, token usage, model performance

### Logfire Setup

Logfire provides structured logging and monitoring for Python applications. It helps you:
- **Monitor application health** and errors
- **Track system metrics** (CPU, memory, GPU usage)
- **Debug issues** with detailed logs
- **Set up alerts** for critical events

#### 1. Create a Logfire Account

1. Sign up at [Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev) (free tier available)
2. Create a new project

#### 2. Get Your Token

1. Go to **Settings → API Tokens**
2. Create a new token
3. Copy the token value

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

**For Hugging Face Spaces:**
```
LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your-logfire-token
ENVIRONMENT=production  # or staging, development
```

**For Koyeb:**
```
LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your-logfire-token
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

**For Local Docker:**
```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 \
  -e HF_TOKEN_LC2=your_token \
  -e LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your-logfire-token \
  -e ENVIRONMENT=development \
  open-finance-llm
```

#### 4. Verify Setup

1. Check Logfire dashboard for logs from your deployment
2. Monitor system metrics and application health
3. Set up alerts for critical events

### Using Both Tools Together

You can use Langfuse and Logfire simultaneously for comprehensive observability:

```bash
# Both tools enabled
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com
LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your-logfire-token
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

**Langfuse** focuses on LLM-specific metrics (tokens, latency, model performance), while **Logfire** provides general application monitoring (logs, system metrics, errors).

### What You Can Monitor

#### Langfuse Metrics:
- ✅ Request/response traces
- ✅ Token usage (input/output)
- ✅ Latency per request
- ✅ Model performance analytics
- ✅ Cost tracking
- ✅ User feedback and scores

#### Logfire Metrics:
- ✅ Application logs
- ✅ System metrics (CPU, memory, GPU)
- ✅ Error tracking
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Custom events

### Best Practices

1. **Start with Langfuse** for LLM-specific observability
2. **Add Logfire** for comprehensive system monitoring
3. **Set up alerts** for high latency or errors
4. **Review metrics regularly** to optimize performance
5. **Use traces** to debug issues and improve prompts
